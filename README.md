# üöÄ AZ-104 Lab Portfolio: Hands-On Cloud Administrator Projects

## üßæ Purpose
This repository documents my hands-on lab work while preparing for the **AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator** certification. My goal is to deepen my practical understanding of Azure services and gain real-world experience as a cloud administrator.

Each lab simulates real scenarios that an Azure Admin would encounter ‚Äî from provisioning virtual machines to configuring identity, networking, and monitoring.
