# üåê Project 3: Virtual Network + VPN Gateway Lab

This project demonstrates how to build a hub-spoke network architecture in Azure, configure a VPN Gateway for Point-to-Site (P2S) connectivity, and establish secure communication between on-premises clients and Azure resources.

## üèóÔ∏è Step 1: Resource Group & VNets

- Created a resource group: **RG-HubSpoke-Lab**

- Created a Hub VNet: **Vnet-Hub** and assigned it to the resource group

- **Deployed the VPN Gateway**:
  - Assigned it to the resource group
  - Linked to the Hub VNet and VPN subnet
  - Assigned static public IP

## üîê Step 4: Create Root Certificate for P2S

Generated a self-signed root certificate using PowerShell:

```powershell
$rootCert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature `
-Subject "CN=MyP2SRootCert" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
-HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `
-CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
-KeyUsageProperty Sign -KeyUsage CertSign

| Parameter                                   | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$rootCert =`                               | Stores the certificate object in a variable for later use            |
| `New-SelfSignedCertificate`                 | Cmdlet to generate a new self-signed certificate                     |
| `-Type Custom`                              | Creates a custom certificate with full configuration options         |
| `-KeySpec Signature`                        | Indicates the certificate is used for digital signatures             |
| `-Subject "CN=MyP2SRootCert"`               | Sets the Common Name (CN) for the certificate                        |
| `-KeyExportPolicy Exportable`               | Allows the certificate‚Äôs private key to be exported                  |
| `-HashAlgorithm sha256`                     | Uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for encryption                    |
| `-KeyLength 2048`                           | Specifies the key length (2048-bit RSA), Azure's recommended minimum |
| `-CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My"` | Location in the certificate store where it will be saved             |
| `-KeyUsageProperty Sign -KeyUsage CertSign` | Marks the certificate for signing other certificates (acts as a CA)  |
```

## üßæ Step 5: Export Certificate

After creating the root certificate, I exported it using the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Export-Certificate -Cert $rootCert -FilePath "C:\MyP2SRootCert.cer"
| Parameter            | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Export-Certificate` | PowerShell cmdlet used to export a certificate to a file      |
| `-Cert $rootCert`    | Specifies the certificate object to export                    |
| `-FilePath "C:\..."` | Defines the full path where the exported `.cer` file is saved |
```
 Issue: When opening the file in Notepad, I saw binary data (unreadable characters), which meant the certificate was exported in binary format instead of Base64.

  ![image](https://github.com/abarnes285/AZ-104-LABS/blob/05743f682dfd445de9176883ee64a184c1b86cc0/Virtual%20Network%20%2B%20VPN%20Gateway/Images/image%2012.png)
## üîÑ Step 6: Export as Base64
üõ†Ô∏è Solution Attempted
To resolve this, I updated the command to specify the export type explicitly:
```Powershell
Export-Certificate -Cert $rootCert -FilePath "C:\Users\andrew.barnes\Desktop\MyP2SRootCert.cer" -Type CERT
```
‚úÖ This command was intended to export the certificate as a Base64-encoded X.509 file.
However, the resulting file still appeared in binary format when opened with a text editor. This led to the next step: manual export via MMC, which is covered in Step 7. 
## üîÑ Step 7: Manually Export Certificate to Base64

After multiple failed attempts to export the certificate as Base64 using PowerShell, I switched to the **MMC (Microsoft Management Console)** to export the certificate in the correct format manually.

### üõ† Steps to Export as Base64-Encoded X.509 (.CER)

1. Press `Win + R`, type `mmc`, and press Enter
2. Go to **File > Add/Remove Snap-in**
3. Select **Certificates** and click **Add**
4. Choose **My user account** and click **Finish**, then **OK**
5. In the left pane, navigate to:

6. Locate the certificate (`MyP2SRootCert`) you created
7. Right-click the cert ‚Üí **All Tasks** ‚Üí **Export**
8. In the Certificate Export Wizard:
- Select **No, do not export the private key**
- Choose **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)**
- Choose a file path (e.g., Desktop) and export the file

### ‚úÖ Result

- The exported certificate can now be opened in a text editor (e.g., Notepad)
- It will be human-readable and look like this:

## üîå Step 8: Install VPN Client & Connect to Azure

After configuring the VPN Gateway and uploading the root certificate, I proceeded to install the VPN client provided by Azure and attempted to connect to the environment using both Windows and macOS.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è A. Install VPN Client on Windows

1. From the Azure Portal:
   - Go to the **VPN Gateway** resource
   - Navigate to **Point-to-site configuration**
   - Download the VPN client package (ZIP)

2. Extract the ZIP file and run the installer (`VpnClientSetupAmd64.exe`)

3. After installation:
   - Open **Windows Settings** ‚Üí **Network & Internet** ‚Üí **VPN**
   - You should see a new VPN profile pre-configured for your Azure environment

   ![VPN Settings](https://github.com/abarnes285/AZ-104-LABS/blob/e3d22ff43831547f4076b03aaad8a860a3538a77/Virtual%20Network%20%2B%20VPN%20Gateway/Images/image%2020.png)
   ![VPN Profile in Windows](https://github.com/abarnes285/AZ-104-LABS/blob/e3d22ff43831547f4076b03aaad8a860a3538a77/Virtual%20Network%20%2B%20VPN%20Gateway/Images/image%2022.png)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Connection Issue

When attempting to connect, I received a connection error:

![VPN Connection Failed](https://github.com/abarnes285/AZ-104-LABS/blob/e3d22ff43831547f4076b03aaad8a860a3538a77/Virtual%20Network%20%2B%20VPN%20Gateway/Images/image%2023.png)

### üîç Root Cause

- I initially **did not select OpenVPN (SSL)** as the tunnel type during the Point-to-Site VPN configuration in Azure.
- OpenVPN is required for compatibility with most clients and devices (especially Mac).

---

### ‚úÖ Resolution

1. Went back to **Point-to-site configuration** in Azure
2. Enabled **OpenVPN (SSL)** as the supported tunnel type
3. Re-downloaded the VPN client after saving the config changes

![Enable OpenVPN Tunnel](https://github.com/abarnes285/AZ-104-LABS/blob/e3d22ff43831547f4076b03aaad8a860a3538a77/Virtual%20Network%20%2B%20VPN%20Gateway/Images/image%2024.png)

---

### üçé B. Connect to Azure VPN from macOS (Tunnelblick)

1. Extract the ZIP package downloaded from Azure
2. Open Tunnelblick on macOS
3. Import the `.ovpn` configuration file found in the extracted folder

4. Connect to the VPN using Tunnelblick

![Tunnelblick VPN Connected](https://github.com/abarnes285/AZ-104-LABS/blob/e3d22ff43831547f4076b03aaad8a860a3538a77/Virtual%20Network%20%2B%20VPN%20Gateway/Images/image%2025.png)

> ‚úÖ I was successfully able to connect to Azure from my Mac using OpenVPN.

##‚úÖ Final Outcome
Verified:

Hub-to-Spoke connectivity

VPN connectivity via P2S

VM-to-VM communication

Gained deep understanding of:

Hub-Spoke architecture

Certificate handling

VPN troubleshooting

##üìÑ Summary
This lab gave me hands-on experience in deploying secure hybrid connectivity in Azure using a hub-spoke network model and VPN Gateway. It required troubleshooting certificate formats, NSG rules, and tunnel types‚Äîall of which deepened my understanding of Azure networking.
